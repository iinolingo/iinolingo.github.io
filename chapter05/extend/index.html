                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>Basically you set the position of whatever you are working on to "-webkit-sticky" first! Then you set another position property to just "sticky". This will
                    completely set it!
                </p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>With affecting the values of the top and left properties it actually changed the positive of this relative box.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>Setting the top to a value of 90 pixels and the right to a value of 10, the fixed box will stay right where it is in the page. It will just essentially follow as you scroll.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>I set bottom to 0 and the right property to 0 as well. This made the absolute box stay relatively still at the bottom of the page.</p>
