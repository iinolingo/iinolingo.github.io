			<p>Hi everyone! I am Oni Hairston and I am a 17 year old programmer who is currently enrolled in a programming and software development class. It is at my trade-school and this is my second year 
				being exposed to coding and I am really loving it so far. I have learned some Java, HTML, and CSS here! My goal is to master some other programming languages(C# or C++) and head out to college for Computer Science.
				This trade-school has also exposed me to many new friends who actually share the same interest as me! I am someone who can be very determined when there is something I want to achieve. I never want to 
				Being a software developer at an amazing company is my ultimate dream!
			</p>
