                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: I used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools color converter!</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>Hexadecimal codes are values that tell how much the color displayed is gonna show, the values range from 0 to 255. There are 16 million different colors! But RGB 
				 uses 8 bits for the red, green, and blue color combinations. It inputs as rgbrgb(230, 255, 204) rather than #e6ffcc. HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. This 
				 is a much more intuitive way though. Hue is determined by the degrees around the circle, saturation is made by the percentage between 0 and 100%. The closer to 100 the less gray.
				  Lightness is pretty self explanatory! It looks like hsl(89, 100%, 90%).</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: I prefer to use hexadecimal codes for the colors because I feel like it is a lot easier to type, plus it is easier for me to understand!</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary: Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness! Its like HSL and the hue can be anywhere within 0 and 360. The other 2 percentages are how much white or black is mixed in. </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary:  Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black are what make up CMYK. The amount of those in percentage is what will determine the color. </p>
