				<p>Hi everyone! I am Oni Hairston and I am a 17 year old programmer who is currently enrolled in a programming and software development class. It is at my trade-school and this is my second year 
					being exposed to coding and I am really loving it so far. I have learned some Java, HTML, and CSS here! My goal is to master some other programming languages(C# or C++) and head out to college for Computer Science.
					This trade-school has also exposed me to many new friends who actually share the same interest as me! I am someone who can be very determined when there is something I want to achieve so  
					becoming a software developer at an amazing company is my ultimate dream! By the way my top favorite things in life are animals, playing video-games, or drawing. Coding is up there as well! 
				</p>
